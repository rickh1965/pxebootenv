# p410.yml


This playbook is intended for a clean proxmox install on a server with a P410 installation. 

###Note:!!

###The server must have it's boot drive *outside* of the controller. Failure to boot from USB or with an adapter from the DVD slot will result in an unbootable system.

Simply run the playbook like this:

```
ansible-playbook p410.yml
```

After completion, the playbook displays lsblk to show that the individual drives are under direct control of the OS.

If you are running an old HP Proliant Gx. Chances are you have an internal raid controller based on the p410i. HBAmode support is somehow not supported by HP. In proxmox, you ZFS and CEPH recomend configuring your server in a way where you are talking directly to the disks not via a RAID controller. You can try to set up RAID 0 LUNS and do it that way or you can disable the RAID controller's dictatorial control over your storage.

I found this:

https://github.com/im-0/hpsahba.git

hpsahba was written by Ivan Mironov mironov.ivan@gmail.com

This executable will give you the ability to flip your controller into HBA mode.

To get this working under proxmox, I found this link in a post on their forum: https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/proxmox-7-on-hp-g7-and-how-to-enable-hba-mode-p410-hpsahba.105320/

The post goes through a very manual set of instructions on how to do this. I simply tightened it up and made this playbook to apply hbamode in a more automated fashion.

Caution!
Failure to pay attention to the directions here or lack of knowledge regarding your controller can render you server unbootable. I take no responsibility for what yu do on your server.
Prerequisites:
Once you execute this playbook, the disks behind your controller will lose the ability to be booted from. You must set up bootiing PERMANENTLY via USB (I boot on the internal USB port) or reconfigure the DVD controller port to boot independently of the disks behind the controller. This is discussed in the forum post I referenced above.

Again, for emphasis. Do not run this playbook until you are booting outside of the RAID controller.

Also, you must have the controller updated to version 6.64. Check HPE's website for what you need to update the controller firmware. The playbook checks for this firmware version and fails if this requirement is not met.

Edit the host section in p410.yml before executing so that the playbook knows where to go. I seperated out my OLD HP servers into their own group for clarity called p410 servers. All the normal requirements apply here. Must be a valid user who can become root on the target and the target server must have a working internet connection. This playbook is intended for a fully configured Proxmox 8.x server.
